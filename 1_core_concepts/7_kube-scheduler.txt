Kube scheduler

The scheduler is only responsible for deciding which pods goes on which nodes. It doesn't actually place the pods on the node. That's the job of the kubelet,
The scheduler decides that depending on some criteria

For example we have a pod which requires at least 10 cpu, it goes through all the nodes to find the right one


-----      -----      -----      -----      

 4          4          12         16         

-----      -----      -----      -----      

1) So firstable it filter the nodes, based on the request cpu

-----      -----          

 12         16   

-----      -----

2) It ranks the node and score a 0-10, for example the scheduler calcutate the resource on the node that will be free after placing the pod
in the node. In this case the first will have 2 cpu the other one will have 6. Since 6 > 2 The 16th cpu node wins. 


Of course you can configure the scheduler behaviour by using tains/tolerations, node affinity etc..


As always you can simply download it from the k8s release install it and running as a service.

kube-scheduler.service
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/kube-scheduler \
 --config=/etc/kubernetes/config/kube-scheduler.yaml \ 
 ..


How do you view the options? Again if you set it up using kubeadm 

$ cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml

As always you can see the actual optiosn by looking at the process

$ ps aux | grep kube-scheduler
