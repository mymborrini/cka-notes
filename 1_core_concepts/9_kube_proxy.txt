Kube Proxy


WIthin a k8s cluster every pod can reach any other pods. This is accomplish by deploying a pod network across the cluster. Throught this network 
pods are able to communicate with each other. As you know when a pod tries to communicate with another pod it goes through a service.

But what is this service? This service cannot join the pod network because is not a container, is a virtual component that only lives in the k8s
memory. The service is accessible from every nodes in the cluster. How is that achive? Throught kube Proxy.  

Kube Proxy is a process that runs on each node in a k8s cluster. It's job is looking for new services and every time a new service is created,
it creates the appropriate rules on each node to forward traffic to those services to the backend pods. One way to do this is using iptables rules.

So for example if the pods A (10.32.0.15) needs to connect to pod B (10.32.0.14) through the sercvice (10.96.0.12). Note that the ip of the service
is not in the same network. It creates an iptable rule to forward the traffic heading to the ip of the service (10.96.0.12) to the ip
of the actual pod (10.32.0.15)


INSTALLATION

you can download the proxy and run it as a service

kube-proxy.service
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/kube-proxy \
 ..

The kubeadm tool deploy kube-proxy on each nodes. In fact is deployed as a daemonset, so each node will have excatly one pod
