ETCD

Etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store that is simple secure and fast

key-value store: means that you store.

Let's considert the difference with a simple table


Name            Age     Location    Salary      Grade
------------------------------------------------------
John Doe        45      New York    5000
Dave Smith      34      New York    4000
Aryan Kumar     10      New York                A 
Lauren ROb      13      Bangalore               C 


As you can see Salary and Grade occupied a lot of null space, tha tabular format for this kind of data leaves to a lot of empty cell. 
A key value stores information in a document or pages like the following

key             value
Name            John Doe
Age             45
Location        New York
Salary          5000


key             value
Name            Dave Smith
Age             34
Location        New York
Salary          4000

key             value
Name            Aryan Kumar
Age             10
Location        New York
Grade           A


key             value
Name            Lauren ROb
Age             13
Location        Bangalore
Grade           C 


All the information about that individual is stored in that document. The advantage is that changing to one file does not change the others.

INSTALL ETCD
You can run etcd as a service and manage it using systemctl.

When started etcd run and listen on port 2379.

A default client that comes with etcd is the etcd default client etcdctl


To set a key value pair

$ etcdctl set key1 value1 

etcd comes with two version: version 2 or version 3. To figure out which one of this the client is configured to communicate

$ etcdctl --version
etcdctl version: 3.3.1
API version 2

In this case even if etcdctl version is set to 3 is important to note that API version is set to 2. 
So in the end the answer to our question is 2, etcdctl is configured to communicate with API version 2

To force etcdctl to work with version 3

$ export ETCDCTL_API=3
$ ./etcdctl version
etcdctl version: 3.3.1
API version 3.3

So with version 3, the command to set a value
$ etcdctl put key1 value1

$ etcdctl get key1
