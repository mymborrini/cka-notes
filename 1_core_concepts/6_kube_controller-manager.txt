Kube Controller Manager

As mentioned before the kube controller manager manages differnet controller in k8s. A controller is a process that continuosly monitor the 
status of a set of resources inside the k8s cluster, and brings the whole system to the desired status. 

For example the node controller is responsible for monitor the status of the nodes and take the necessary actions. It does that, of course through
the kube api-server, to communicate with every single node. 

Node monitor Period: 5s
Node monitor Grace Period: 40s
POD Eviction Timeout: 5m

The node controller monitor the status of the node every 5 seconds.
If the Node controller does not recive any beat for a node for 40 seconds, it will marked it as UNREACHABLE.
If the node does not come back to life within 5 minutes, it removes the pod inside that node and assign them to different nodes. If they are
part of a replicaSet 


The Replication Controller, monitor the status of the replica in the replicaset to be sure that the number of the pods is always the one desired.
If a pod is deleted it creates a new one. 

How do I see this controller, and where they are located in the cluster? They are all packaged into the kube-controller-manager, when you install 
the kube-controller-manager the different controllers will be deployed as well.

kubec-controller-manager.service
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/kube-controller-manager \
...
--controllers *
...

By default all controllers are enabled, but you can specify only a set of them, or disable with a dash in front some of them. So in case some
of my contoller seems not to exists this could be a good starting point to search.

How do you view the kube-controller-manager options, again it dependends on how you set up your cluster.

If you use kubeadm

$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system
kube-controller-manager-master 

and you can see the options at

$ cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml

Or if you set up it manually.

$ cat /etc/systemd/system/kube-controller-manager.service

cat /etc/systemd/system/kube-controller-manager.service
